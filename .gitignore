# A gitignore for Altera Quartus II that tries to ignore almost all of the
# automatically Quartus-generated files. This primarily leaves the project,
# settings, source, and constraint files to be added. The files ignored do not
# include the bulk of the MegaFunction Wizard generated files which enables
# a cloned repository to be used (usually) immediately without regenerating
# Altera IP blocks.

# Need to keep all HDL files and timing constraint files
